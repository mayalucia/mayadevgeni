#+title: MayaDevGenI Development Log
#+startup: overview

* Open Threads
** TODO [MayaDevGenI] Implement message parser in mayadevgenz
   - Parser sketch exists in =llm-message-convention.org=
   - Needs integration with gptel workflow
   - Test with real conversation buffers

** TODO [MayaDevGenI] <placeholder — describe an active question>

* Decision Log
** <2026-02-08> Devlog structure adopted
   - Context: Need to track development decisions and progress across sessions with AI collaborators.
   - Decision: Adopted structured devlog format with three sections — open threads, decision log, work log.
   - Alternatives considered: Formal project management tools (too heavy), pure git log (loses narrative/intent).
   - Consequences: Each project maintains its own devlog. A top-level index links them.

* Work Log
** <2025-01-20> Session: LLM Message Convention Design
   - Collaborator: mu2tau + claude
   - Context: Earlier conversation got mangled due to gptel property manipulation; motivated robust convention.
   - Outcome: Designed and documented Org-native LLM message convention.
   
   *Key design decisions:*
   - Hybrid approach: Headlines for topic organization, blocks for message boundaries
   - Block syntax: =#+begin_message :role ROLE :name NAME [:key value]...=
   - "Blocks are islands" rule: blocks override role locally, don't affect surrounding content
   - Bare content inherits role from headline tags (=:@user:=, =:@assistant:=) or defaults to user
   - =:SEND_TO_API: no= property excludes content from API
   - End-anchoring convention: final question is primary focus
   
   *Artifacts created:*
   - =develop/llm-message-convention.org= — full convention spec
   - Elisp parser sketch for extracting messages
   - Skeletons and structure templates for quick entry
   - System prompt section for agent integration
   
   *Integrated into agents:*
   - Added =<conversation-structure>= to agent system prompts
   
   - Next: Implement parser in =mayadevgenz=, test with real conversations.

** <2026-02-08> Session: Devlog scaffolding
   - Created devlog structure for MayaDevGenI.
   - Next: Populate open threads from existing project documents.
