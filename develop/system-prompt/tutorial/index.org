#+title: System-Prompt Tutorial: Index

A practical guide to crafting system-prompts for LLM collaboration.

* Overview

This tutorial develops fluency in writing system-prompts—the hidden preambles that shape LLM behavior before conversation begins. We move from foundational concepts through practical craft to advanced techniques.

The approach is grounded in a statistical-physics perspective: system-prompts as potential landscapes that bias token generation toward desired behaviors. But you don't need physics to benefit. The principles translate into concrete practices that work.

* Reading Paths

** The Quick Path
If you want to start writing prompts immediately:
1. [[file:01-why.org][01-why]] — understand the stakes
2. [[file:04-craft.org][04-craft]] — learn the principles
3. [[file:05-failures.org][05-failures]] — know the pitfalls

** The Complete Path
For a thorough understanding, read sequentially from [[file:01-why.org][01-why]] through [[file:08-skills.org][08-skills]]. Each file builds on the previous, and navigation links guide you through.

** The Practitioner's Path
If you're ready to build a complex prompt for a real collaboration:
1. Skim [[file:07-scaling.org][07-scaling]] to understand the architecture
2. Open [[file:template.org][template]] and work through it section by section
3. Tangle to produce your prompt
4. Test and refine using [[file:06-iterate.org][06-iterate]] as your guide
