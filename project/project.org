#+title: MayaDevGenI: Project Roadmap
#+author: MayaDevGenI Collaboration
#+startup: overview


* Overview

This document tracks the development roadmap for MayaDevGenI—a framework for
principled human-machine collaboration.

*Scope*: We fulfill the promises made in [[file:../develop/develop.org][develop.org]], building on the
philosophical foundations in [[file:manifesto.org][manifesto.org]].

*Status Legend*:
| Symbol | Meaning         |
|--------+-----------------|
| 🔴    | Not started     |
| 🟡    | In progress     |
| 🟢    | Complete        |
| ⏸️    | Blocked/On hold |
*


* Completed Foundations

These components exist and are functionally complete:

- 🟢 *Philosophy*: [[file:manifesto.org][Manifesto]] — stance on human-machine collaboration
- 🟢 *Theory*: [[file:../develop/develop.org::*System-Prompt Engineering][System-Prompt Engineering]] — statistical physics lens
- 🟢 *Tutorial*: [[file:../develop/system-prompt/tutorial/index.org][System-Prompt Tutorial]] — 7 chapters + template
- 🟢 *Tool-Use*: [[file:../develop/tool-use/tool-use-tutorial.org][Tool-Use Tutorial]] — decision trees, patterns, case studies
- 🟢 *Library*: Three working system-prompts (thinking-together, collaborative-intelligence, mayadevgeni)

:VISIBILITY: children

** EPIC-0: Setup a Website for =MayaDevGenI= 🟡
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: Low
:PRIORITY: High
:END:

Create a public-facing website for MayaDevGenI using Hugo and ox-hugo.
The site serves dual purposes: project documentation and professional
portfolio enhancement.

*Rationale*: A polished web presence transforms a git repository into a
demonstrable artifact—showing not just what was built, but how it was
thought about.

*** Goals
- Publish existing org documentation as a navigable website
- Establish professional presence without conventional certification path
- Enable iterative refinement as project evolves

*** Tasks
- [ ] Setup: Initialize Hugo site structure in =website/= directory
- [ ] Setup: Configure ox-hugo for org→Hugo export
- [ ] Content: Export mayadevgeni.org as landing page
- [ ] Content: Export manifesto.org
- [ ] Content: Export tutorial chapters
- [ ] Content: Export develop.org and related materials
- [ ] Style: Select and configure Hugo theme (clean, minimal, professional)
- [ ] Deploy: Choose hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel)
- [ ] Deploy: Configure custom domain (optional, future)
- [ ] Polish: Navigation, cross-references, visual coherence

*** Deliverables
- =website/= directory with Hugo project
- Ox-hugo configuration in org files (=#+hugo_*= directives)
- Deployed site (URL TBD)
- Documentation for site maintenance workflow

*** Technical Notes
- *ox-hugo*: Single org file → multiple Hugo posts, or one-post-per-file
- *Theme candidates*: PaperMod, Congo, Ananke (evaluate for documentation fit)
- *Workflow*: Edit org → =C-c C-e H H= (ox-hugo export) → =hugo server= → preview

** EPIC-1: Context Management Framework 🔴
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: Medium
:PRIORITY: High
:END:

Develop the theory and practice of managing finite context windows in
extended collaborations.

*Stub location*: [[file:../develop/develop.org::*Context Management][develop.org § Context Management]]

*** Tasks
- [ ] Research: Survey existing approaches (gptel, aider, cursor, continue)
- [ ] Theory: Develop information-theoretic model of context degradation
- [ ] Document: Client-side context window strategies
- [ ] Document: Summarization techniques (when, how, what to preserve)
- [ ] Document: Decision framework: refresh vs. continue vs. new session
- [ ] Practice: Worked examples with gptel

*** Deliverables
- Context management section in develop.org (replace stub)
- Practical guidelines document
- gptel configuration examples


** EPIC-2: Project Memory System 🔴
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: Medium
:PRIORITY: High
:END:

Design patterns for maintaining continuity across sessions—the LLM's
"long-term memory" problem.

*Stub location*: [[file:../develop/develop.org::*Project Memory][develop.org § Project Memory]]

*** Tasks
- [ ] Research: Analyze CHANGELOG, AGENTS.md, session-log patterns
- [ ] Design: Session log format (what to capture, how to structure)
- [ ] Design: Project knowledge base structure
- [ ] Document: "Catching up" protocols for new sessions
- [ ] Document: When to persist vs. let go
- [ ] Practice: Implement for MayaDevGenI itself (dogfooding)

*** Deliverables
- Project memory section in develop.org (replace stub)
- Session log template
- CHANGELOG pattern guide
- MayaDevGenI's own CHANGELOG


** EPIC-3: Agent Architecture Patterns 🔴
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: High
:PRIORITY: Medium
:END:

Articulate when and how to use single vs. multi-agent architectures,
delegation patterns, and orchestration.

*Stub location*: [[file:../develop/develop.org::*Agent Architecture][develop.org § Agent Architecture]]

*** Tasks
- [ ] Research: Survey agent patterns (researcher, executor, introspector, planner)
- [ ] Theory: When single-agent suffices vs. multi-agent required
- [ ] Document: Delegation decision framework
- [ ] Document: Orchestrator patterns (supervisor, peer, hierarchical)
- [ ] Document: Agent communication protocols
- [ ] Document: Failure modes in multi-agent systems
- [ ] Practice: Case study with gptel-agent

and agent configurations.

*Stub location*: [[file:../develop/develop.org::*Evaluation and Iteration][develop.org § Evaluation and Iteration]]

- [ ] Design: Test case structure (prompt → expected behavior → actual)
- [ ] Design: Regression detection methodology
- [ ] Document: Refinement loop process
- [ ] Document: Metrics that matter (and those that mislead)
- [ ] Tool: Evaluation harness concept (even if manual)
- [ ] Practice: Test suite for MayaDevGenI system-prompts

- [ ] Document: Editor-agnostic principles
- [ ] Practice: MayaDevGenI gptel configuration

*** Deliverables
- Integration patterns section in develop.org (replace stub)

- Repository convention templates


** EPIC-6: Documentation Polish 🟡
:PROPERTIES:
:EFFORT: Low
:PRIORITY: Low
:END:

Review, validate, and polish existing documentation for consistency
and completeness.

*** Tasks
- [ ] Review: All 7 tutorial chapters for completeness
- [ ] Review: Tool-use tutorial for consistency with develop.org
- [ ] Review: System-prompt library documentation
- [ ] Harmonize: Cross-references between documents
- [ ] Add: Navigation aids (index, glossary if needed)

*** Deliverables
- Reviewed and polished tutorial
- Consistent cross-references
- Complete index.org files where missing


* Sequencing Notes

*Suggested order*:

1. *EPIC-1 & EPIC-2* (parallel) — These are foundational for sustained
   collaboration. Without context management and project memory, long
   projects degrade.

2. *EPIC-4* — Evaluation framework needed before we can confidently
   iterate on agents.

3. *EPIC-3* — Agent architecture builds on evaluation capability.

4. *EPIC-5* — Integration patterns are downstream of everything else.

5. *EPIC-6* — Polish happens throughout but finishes last.

*Dependencies*:
- EPIC-3 benefits from EPIC-4 (test agents as you design them)
- EPIC-5 benefits from all others (integration requires mature patterns)
