"In 3 sessions, one physicist built a neuroscience toolkit (293 tests),
wrote a verified manuscript, implemented C++ simulation engines."
--- MāyāLucIA Manifesto, February 2026

"Gas Town can handle super long, fussy tasks (think big puzzle marathons)
without falling apart."
--- Steve Yegge, January 2026

Steve Yegge ships software. He runs 20--30 concurrent Claude Code agents,
each producing merge requests that a Refinery processes into a production
codebase. The output is measurable: lines of code, PRs merged, beads
completed.

What do /we/ ship? And to whom?

This document confronts the question directly. We take the Gas Town
provocation seriously --- can a lone scientist command 20 agents? --- and
ask what that would look like refracted through the MayaDevGenI framework,
applied to the concrete work happening in MāyāLucIA, MāyaPramāṇa, and
the Sūtra relay. We propose a shipping roadmap that is honest about what
exists, what is speculative, and what is merely aspiration.


* The Audience: The Lone Scientist

Our user is not a startup founder managing a development team. Our user is a single researcher --- possibly in a lab, possibly independent --- who wants to understand natural phenomena with the help of machine intelligence.

This scientist:
- Has deep domain expertise (they know the physics, the biology, the mathematics)
- Lacks bandwidth (one person, finite hours, too many threads)
- Cares about /correctness/ more than /speed/ (a wrong model is worse than no model)
- Thinks in terms of /understanding/, not /features/
- Works with code but code is not the product --- the /model/ is
- Publishes papers, not packages

Gas Town's Overseer is a software manager. Our Principal is a scientist. The distance between them is not just stylistic; it determines every architectural choice downstream.

* Can Twenty Agents Help a Scientist?

The honest answer is: not the way Gas Town uses them, but yes, in a
fundamentally different configuration.

** The Gas Town Configuration (why it fails for science)

In Gas Town, 20 agents all do the same thing: implement features, fix bugs, write code. They are interchangeable Polecats dispatched by a Mayor. Differentiation is positional (which task is on whose hook), not cognitive.

For science, this configuration fails on three counts:

1. *Scientific work is not decomposable into independent tasks.*
   A Gas Town Mayor can break "add dark mode" into 20 independent file changes. But "understand how the mushroom body integrates sensory input" is not a set of parallelisable subtasks --- it is a /dialogue/ between observation, modelling, and critique. The subtasks have complex dependencies that only emerge during the work.

2. *The merge queue is the wrong quality mechanism.*
   The Refinery checks: "Do tests pass after rebase?" For code, this suffices. For science: a model can pass all tests and still be wrong. The Bloch equation simulation can be numerically correct while the physical interpretation is mistaken. Tests verify /implementation/; they do not verify /understanding/.

3. *The scientist cannot review 20 concurrent outputs.*
   Gas Town's acknowledged bottleneck is human review. For a startup with a team of reviewers, this is a staffing problem. For a lone scientist, it is a physical impossibility. Twenty simultaneous code branches are not twenty simultaneous insights.

** The Workshop Configuration (what would work)

Instead of 20 identical workers, imagine 20 agents with /distinct
cognitive roles/, most of them inactive at any moment, activated
by the work's own rhythm:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
#+end_example

In this configuration:
- Most agents are /dormant/ most of the time
- Activation is /demand-driven/ by the work's phase (measuring? invoke
  Observer. Modelling? invoke Theorist. Evaluating? invoke Critic.)
- The Guide maintains coherence across activations
- The Phantom Faculty (5 voices) activate for /pedagogy/ --- when the
  scientist needs to understand a concept at deeper levels
- The Sūtra relay carries context across sessions and machines
- The scientist is not an Overseer receiving notifications; they are
  the /principal/ directing the inquiry

This is not 20 concurrent workers. It is a /repertory company/ of
specialised intelligences, available on call, each bringing a different
cognitive mode to bear when the work requires it.

* What Yegge Ships vs. What We Ship

** Yegge's Deliverables

Gas Town produces:
- Merge requests on git repositories
- Beads state (issue tracking in Dolt)
- Code (the actual software artifacts)
- The orchestrator itself (225k lines of Go)

The packaging is: =git clone && gt up=. The value proposition: "Give me
a task description and I give you merged PRs."

** Our Deliverables (Current and Planned)

We produce things that are not PRs:

#+end_table

The packaging problem is real: conventions are harder to ship than software. You cannot =pip install= a convention. But conventions /scale better than tooling/ (the inventory document's central argument): a convention requires a plain text file, an agent that can read, and git. No servers, no APIs, no accounts.

** The Shipping Gap

Yegge can say: "Here is Gas Town. Install it. Run 20 agents." His artifact is a tool.

We cannot yet say the equivalent. Our closest: "Here is the MayaDevGenI tutorial (9 chapters). Here are the agent definitions. Here is the Sūtra protocol. Here is the MāyāLoom convention. Clone these repos and you have a framework for human-machine scientific collaboration."

This is not a tool. It is a /methodology/. The gap between a methodology and a tool is the gap between a recipe and a kitchen appliance. Both produce meals; only one requires the cook to understand what they are doing.

For our audience --- scientists who /want/ to understand --- the methodology may be more valuable than the tool. But it demands more from the user, and it is harder to evaluate before adopting.


* What We Can Ship, and When

** Tier 1: Ready Now (needs packaging, not building)

*** The Sūtra Protocol: "Git as a Message Bus"

The strongest standalone publication candidate. Material exists:
- Sūtra v0 protocol with literature survey (comparing Google A2A, MCP, mcp-agent-mail, AGENTS.md, Claude Squad, CrewAI, LangGraph, Google ADK, Composio, Augment Code Intent)
- The v0 → v1 design evolution narrative (failure-driven design)
- 12+ relay messages as worked examples
- =git log HEAD..origin/main= as the read protocol

*Packaging*: A standalone git repo with =CLAUDE.md=, a =relay/= directory, and a 5-page protocol document. Any agent that can read a =CLAUDE.md= can participate immediately.

*Audience*: Anyone running AI agents across multiple machines who wants cross-session coordination without infrastructure.

*Publication angle*: "Git as a Message Bus: Convention-Driven Multi-Agent Coordination Without Infrastructure."

*Relationship to Gas Town*: Sūtra solves the same cross-session problem Gas Town solves with Beads/Dolt, but with /zero infrastructure/. Where Gas Town adds layers (Dolt database, MCP server, tmux management), Sūtra removes them. The comparison is itself a publication-worthy argument about convention vs. infrastructure.

*** The Verified Manuscript Convention

Material exists:
- Three verified manuscripts in Bravli (mushroom body dynamics, executable manuscripts survey, cortical predictive coding)
- 293 automated tests backing 29 quantitative claims
- The "clone && pytest" verification standard
- Inline test badges in self-contained HTML

*Packaging*: A template repository with the ORG structure, test infrastructure, and badge generation tooling.

*Audience*: Computational scientists who want their papers to be mechanically verifiable.

*** The MayaDevGenI Tutorial

Nine chapters on system-prompt engineering, already published at devgeni.mayalucia.dev. Covers: why system prompts matter, anatomy, landscape, craft, failure modes, iteration, scaling, skills, Emacs integration.

*Packaging*: Already shipped. Needs promotion.

** Tier 2: Needs Building (3-6 months)

*** The Guide Agent (Orchestrator)

The critical missing piece for multi-agent workflows. The Guide needs to:
- Receive tasks from the human
- Decompose into agent-appropriate subtasks
- Route to Observer/Theorist/Builder/Sculptor/Critic
- Manage handoffs between agents
- Present synthesis to the human at review gates

*Complexity*: This is the /Mayor/ of our system, but with fundamentally different semantics. Gas Town's Mayor dispatches identical workers to independent tasks. Our Guide routes to /specialised cognitive modes/ where the output of one shapes the input of the next.

*What Gas Town teaches*: The Mayor's =gt sling= and =gt mail= patterns
are relevant. We need a dispatch mechanism and a communication protocol.
Sūtra's relay is the communication layer. The dispatch mechanism should
be convention-based (the Guide reads a task specification and decides
which archetype to invoke) rather than API-based.

*** Durable Execution for Long Scientific Workflows

A quantum sensor controller curriculum (MāyaPramāṇa) spans 8 lessons. A digital twin reconstruction (Bravli) spans weeks of iterative refinement. These exceed single context windows.

We need Gas Town's /checkpointing/ without Gas Town's /infrastructure/. Proposal:

#+begin_src org
,* Checkpoint: lesson-02-optical-pumping
,** Status
Lesson structure drafted. Python implementation complete.
Haskell spec: 3 of 5 functions implemented.
C++ code: not started.
,** Artifacts
- lessons/02-optical-pumping/concept.org (lines 1-180: complete)
- python session: pumping rates match Table 2 of Happer 1972
,** Next
- Complete Haskell QuickCheck properties for pumping equilibrium
- Begin C++ header with dimensional types
,** Open Questions
- Collision broadening: include in lesson or defer to lesson 03?
  [Needs human decision]
,** Conventions Active
- MāyāLoom: cadenza blocks at `:concept optical-pumping`
- Cross-language validation: Python generates reference JSON
#+end_src

This is a checkpoint an arriving agent can parse and resume from. Machine-readable, human-readable, stored in git. No Dolt required.

*** The Phantom Faculty as Shippable Convention

Five agent personas with distinct epistemological stances, used to generate pedagogical content targeted at specific knowledge gaps.

*What exists*: Five =.md= system prompts, the cadenza protocol (6-field expansion specification), and one fully expanded lesson (Bloch sphere geometry in all five voices).

*What's needed*: More worked examples (at least 3-4 more cadenza expansions across different topics), documentation of the convention, and a template repository.

*Publication angle*: "The Phantom Faculty: Teaching Physics Through LLM Personas of Great Physicists."

** Tier 3: Research Direction (6-12 months)

*** The Scientist's Swarm: Selective Parallelism

Not 20 identical workers, but 3-5 agents running /genuinely independent/ workstreams with human-gated integration:

#+begin_example
Scientist directs:
  Agent A (Builder): implement Lesson 02, optical pumping
  Agent B (Observer): curate SRTM elevation data for Parbati
  Agent C (Critic): review Bravli manuscript claims against new data

These touch different submodules. No merge conflicts.
The scientist reviews each output independently.
Integration happens at the conceptual level (human judgment),
not the code level (automated merge).
#+end_example

This is Claude Squad's model (tmux panes, git worktrees) applied to scientific work. The innovation is not technical --- it is /architectural/: the agents work on different /cognitive tasks/ in different /domains/, coordinated by the scientist's understanding of how the pieces fit together.

*What Gas Town teaches*: The git worktree pattern is directly
applicable. Each agent gets a worktree per submodule. The merge strategy
is trivial because the workstreams are independent.

*What we add*: The workstreams are not interchangeable tasks; they are different /phases/ of a scientific inquiry (observing, building, critiquing), happening to advance in parallel because the scientist has bandwidth for all three and they genuinely do not interfere.

*** Verification Sweeps

Gas Town's "Sweeps" adapted for science: periodic agent-driven audits
of the entire project state.

#+begin_src org
,* Verification Sweep: 2026-Q2
,** Bravli
- [ ] All 293 tests pass on current main
- [ ] Manuscript claim-test mappings still valid
- [ ] New data from FlyWire v3: any invalidations?
,** MāyaPramāṇa
- [ ] Lesson 00 Python/Haskell/C++ outputs match
- [ ] Bloch equation reference JSON up-to-date
- [ ] New cadenza expansions consistent with `:prereqs`
,** MāyaPortal
- [ ] SDL3 API changes since last build
- [ ] WebGPU spec changes affecting lesson pipeline
,** Cross-Module
- [ ] Submodule pointers in mayalucia parent are consistent
- [ ] Sūtra relay: any unactioned pending messages
#+end_src

A Critic agent runs this sweep quarterly, reports findings, and the scientist decides what to act on.

*** The Convention Package Manager

If conventions are our unit of shipping, we need a way to /discover, evaluate, and adopt/ them. Not a package manager in the npm sense --- but a curated registry of convention documents that any project can import by copying a =CLAUDE.md= section and a directory structure.

#+begin_example
mayaconventions/
  sutra/           → Cross-machine relay protocol
  verified-ms/     → Verified manuscript convention
  mayaloom/        → Adaptive prerequisite teaching
  phantom-faculty/ → Epistemologically-distinct agent personas
  turiya/          → Human-machine collaboration principles
#+end_example

Each convention is: a 1-page spec, a worked example, a =CLAUDE.md= snippet, and a directory template. "Clone this repo. Copy the convention you want into your project. Your agents will follow it."


* The Twenty-Agent Question, Answered

Can a lone scientist command 20 agents? Yes, but not the way Yegge imagines.

** Gas Town's 20: a production line

#+begin_example
1 Mayor → 20 identical Polecats → 1 Refinery → main branch

All agents do the same thing (implement features).
Throughput is the metric.
Quality is: do tests pass?
The human reviews merged PRs.
#+end_example

** Our 20: a repertory company

#+begin_example
1 Guide (orchestrator)
1 Observer (data curation)
1 Theorist (model construction)
3 Builders (Python / Haskell / C++, one per language)
1 Sculptor (visualisation, documentation)
1 Critic (adversarial review)
5 Phantom Faculty (pedagogical voices)
2-3 parallel workers (independent submodule tasks)
1 Relay agent (Sūtra message management)
1 Sweep agent (periodic verification)
~ 2 spare capacity for ad hoc tasks
---
≈ 18-20 agents total
#+end_example

Most are dormant at any time. Activation is phase-driven:
- /Measuring phase/: Observer active, Theorist on standby
- /Modelling phase/: Theorist active, Builders on standby
- /Manifesting phase/: Builders active (possibly in parallel, one per language), Sculptor preparing
- /Evaluating phase/: Critic active, Sweep agent checking
- /Teaching phase/: Faculty active, expanding cadenzas
- /Coordination/: Guide always active, Relay processing messages

The scientist does not review 20 concurrent outputs. They direct the inquiry: "We are in the modelling phase. Theorist, propose a model for optical pumping dynamics. Critic, stand by to review."

The twenty agents are a /capacity/, not a /workload/. The scientist uses them like a musician uses the keys of a piano: all 88 are available, but a chord needs only 3-5.


* What We Can Learn from Gas Town

** 1. Ship the Orchestrator

Yegge shipped Gas Town. It exists. You can clone it and run it. We have not shipped our Guide agent. Until we do, our multi-agent framework is a specification, not a system.

** 2. Make Conventions Executable

Sūtra is a convention that agents follow by reading a =CLAUDE.md=. But "follow the Sūtra protocol" requires the agent to /interpret/ a text document and decide what to do. Gas Town's =gt sling=, =gt done=, =gt handoff= are /commands/ that agents execute. Commands are more reliable than conventions for mechanical tasks.

The synthesis: conventions for /cognitive/ tasks (how to think, what to prioritise, when to push back). Commands for /mechanical/ tasks (dispatch, checkpoint, merge). We should not be afraid to build tools for the mechanical parts while keeping conventions for the cognitive parts.

** 3. Solve Context Window Exhaustion

Gas Town's =gt handoff= is a real solution to a real problem. Our framework pretends context windows are infinite (or that session logs bridge the gap). They are not. We need a checkpoint-and-resume mechanism, even if it is as simple as a structured ORG section that an arriving agent can parse.

** 4. Invest in Machine Descriptions

Gas Town agents know their capabilities. Our agents discover their environment ad hoc each session. Formalising machine descriptors --- what tools are available, what repos are accessible, what build systems work --- reduces the cost of the "assess" step in every session bootstrap.

** 5. Track What Agents Accomplish

Gas Town's CV chains are excessive (persistent identity risks bias), but the impulse is correct: somewhere, there should be a record of what each session accomplished. Our session logs serve this purpose but are unstructured. A lightweight convention for session summaries (what was done, what was decided, what remains) would strengthen session continuity without the risks of persistent identity.

* Closing: The Factory and the Workshop

Yegge sees the future of coding as industrialisation. More agents, faster execution, automated quality control. Gas Town is the factory floor.

We see the future of /scientific work/ with AI as /deepened partnership/. Not more agents but /better-matched/ agents. Not faster output but /more rigorous understanding/. Not automated quality control but /structural epistemic hygiene/.

Both visions are valid for their domains. Gas Town is right that coding can be industrialised --- much of it is routine, parallelisable, and verifiable by automated tests. The workshop model is right that science cannot be --- understanding is sequential, judgment-dependent, and verifiable only by the prepared mind.

The lone scientist does not need a factory. They need a workshop with excellent tools, knowledgeable colleagues (even if some are machine intelligences), and the /freedom to think slowly/.

Gas Town makes agents fast. We aim to make the scientist /deeper/.

/The question is not "how do we build a platform?" It is "what is the
minimal set of conventions that makes multi-agent coordination emerge
from tools everyone already has?" Our answer: a CLAUDE.md, a .sutra/
directory, and git./
