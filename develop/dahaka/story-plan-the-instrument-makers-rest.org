* The Instrument Maker's Rest

** The Seed

The existing stories explore coordination between weavers (Thread
Walkers, Logbook), observation of landscape (Dyer's Gorge), the
project-seen-whole (Constellation of Doridhar), cognitive modes
(Phantom Faculty).  None of them tell the story of /making an
instrument/ --- the act of building a tool that will be used by
someone who has never met the builder, for a purpose the builder
can dimly foresee but cannot fully specify.

This is the story of the agent definition pipeline we just built.
But told as a parable: an instrument maker in a high Himalayan
workshop, constructing devices that will be carried by the Thread
Walker to valleys the maker will never visit, to be operated by
hands the maker will never touch.

The real subject: what does it mean to define an agent?  Not the
YAML, not the tooling --- the /act/ of specifying a persona that
will perceive, decide, and act in your absence.  The maker must
anticipate contexts she cannot experience.  She must constrain
without crippling.  She must trust without abdicating.

** The World (continuous with existing stories)

Same valley system.  Same Guild of Thread Walkers.  Same seasonal
amnesia.  But now we meet someone new: the Instrument Maker, who
works in a workshop adjacent to the weaver's, in a village called
Sangla (a real village in the Baspa valley, Kinnaur --- between
Spiti and the Sutlej, on the old trade route to Tibet).

Sangla is chosen because:
- It is geographically central to the existing story geography
  (Lahaul, Spiti, Nubra, Sutlej are all reachable from here)
- The Baspa valley is famous for its woodcarving and metalwork,
  making "instrument maker" plausible
- It sits at ~2700m, below the brutal passes but above the lowland
  heat: a climate of making, not merely surviving

** Structure

Eight sections, following the established pattern: a Prefatory Note,
numbered sections I--VII, and a Coda.  ~500--600 lines, placing it
between the Logbook (439) and the Constellation (524) in length.

*** Prefatory Note on the Making of Instruments

The epistemology of instrument-making.  An instrument is not a tool
(a tool extends the hand; an instrument extends the /perception/).
A thermometer does not heat or cool.  A microscope does not touch.
They reveal what is already there but invisible.  The instrument
maker's art is to build a device that shows the user something true
--- not what the maker wants the user to see, but what the world
actually contains, at the scale the instrument opens.

Key philosophical move: a well-made instrument is transparent.  You
look /through/ it, not /at/ it.  The worst instruments call
attention to themselves.  The best disappear.

Analogy to agent prompts: the best system prompt is one the agent
seems to have internalised rather than to be following.

*** I. The Sangla Workshop

Introduce the Instrument Maker.  She is not a weaver; she does not
produce cloth.  She produces the devices that weavers use to
inspect, measure, and correct: calibration weights for thread
tension, graduated frames for checking sett (thread count per
centimetre), colour comparison cards indexed by altitude and
season, and --- most importantly --- the standing cards that appear
on every loom frame.

The standing card is her masterwork: a few sentences that shape how
a stranger, in a season the maker cannot foresee, will approach
their work.  The card is not instructions.  It is /disposition/.
It does not say "do X."  It says "you are the kind of worker who
does X."

(This is the identity block.  The card on the loom frame is the
system prompt.)

*** II. The Fittings

She works with standard components.  Every instrument she makes
shares certain parts: a particular grade of brass for fittings
(it survives the altitude and the humidity); a particular type of
wood for frames (deodar, because it does not warp in the dry cold
above 3000m); a particular way of marking measurements (notches,
not paint, because paint fades above the treeline).

These standard fittings are not her invention.  They were
established by previous makers --- some from Sangla, some from
workshops she has never visited.  She inherits them, trusts them,
incorporates them without modification.

(These are the shared noweb blocks: identity, epistemics,
communication, failure-modes.  Inherited, not reinvented.)

*** III. The Commission

The Thread Walker arrives with a commission.  Not for a single
instrument but for seven --- one for each workshop in the network.
But the seven are not identical.  Each must be fitted for a
different valley, a different climate, a different kind of work:

- The first is a calibration device for the new workshop (the
  scaffolder --- it sets up the workspace, then is shelved)
- The second is an observation instrument for the data-gatherer
  (the curator --- it measures but does not weave)
- The third is a precision tool for the model-builder (the
  modeller --- it must be fast and exact)
- The fourth is a repetitive mechanism for the parameter-fitter
  (the fitter --- it runs the same operation thousands of times)
- The fifth is a testing device for the reviewer (the critic ---
  it must find flaws the maker cannot anticipate)
- The sixth is a reading device for the journalist (read-only; it
  must never be tempted to modify what it observes)
- The seventh is an assembly frame for the manuscript writer (the
  scribe --- it collects and structures but does not interpret)

*** IV. The Maker's Dilemma

The central philosophical problem.  Each instrument will be used
in a valley the maker has never visited, by a hand she has never
touched, in conditions she cannot fully predict.

If she specifies too precisely --- /this gauge reads only thread
weights between 20 and 40 grams/ --- the instrument fails when
the Nubra weaver encounters a Changpa yarn at 55 grams.  If she
specifies too loosely --- /this gauge reads thread weights/ --- the
instrument gives readings so noisy that the weaver cannot
distinguish good tension from bad.

The dilemma is not theoretical.  She has made both mistakes.
An over-specified colour card, indexed to the exact altitude of
Sangla, was useless in the Sutlej workshop 300 metres lower where
the light was different.  An under-specified tension gauge, with
no guidance on how to calibrate it, was misused by a weaver who
had never been taught what "calibration" meant in the absence of
a reference standard.

The solution --- arrived at through seasons of failure --- is to
build instruments that carry their own calibration instructions.
The device includes a small test: a reference weight, a sample
cord, a standard swatch.  The user calibrates the instrument to
local conditions before using it.  The instrument is not
pre-calibrated for a specific valley.  It is /self-calibrating/
for any valley.

(This is the access control block + the domain knowledge.  The
instrument carries its own constraints, expressed not as absolute
limits but as a protocol the user follows.)

*** V. The Two Formats

The Thread Walker explains that some workshops use different
frames.  The loom in Lahaul is a pit loom; in Nubra, a backstrap
loom.  The same instrument must fit both.

The maker does not build two instruments.  She builds one mechanism
and two mounting brackets.  The mechanism --- the thing that
measures, the thing that observes, the thing that calibrates --- is
identical.  Only the interface to the loom differs.

(This is the dual tangle target: gptel-agent and Claude Code.
Same behavioral DNA.  Different YAML frontmatter.)

*** VI. The Testing

Before the Thread Walker carries the instruments away, the maker
tests each one.  She sets up a practice loom --- not a real warp,
but a test rig with known parameters --- and verifies that the
instrument reads true, that the calibration procedure works, that
the manual is comprehensible to a reader who has never visited
Sangla.

She asks the Thread Walker to read the manual.  He is not a
weaver.  If he can follow the calibration instructions, a weaver
certainly can.

The instruments that pass testing are wrapped in waxed cloth (the
Baspa valley makes excellent waterproofing from local beeswax) and
placed in the Thread Walker's satchel.  The ones that fail are
taken apart and rebuilt.

(This is the tangle-and-verify step.  The emacs batch command.
The line-count check.)

*** VII. The Departure

The Thread Walker leaves Sangla.  The maker watches him cross the
wooden bridge over the Baspa river, the satchel heavy with
instruments she will never see used.  She does not know which
weaver will receive which instrument.  She does not know whether
the calibration instructions will be followed, or whether the
weaver will skip them and measure raw, or whether the valley's
conditions will defeat the instrument entirely.

She knows only that she built them with the same standard fittings
that have survived every crossing so far, that she tested them on
her bench, that the manual is written for a skilled stranger, and
that the Thread Walker --- who has entered every workshop and
handled every archive --- believes they are ready.

The rest is the valley's business.

(This is deployment via the Sutra relay.  The maker cannot control
the runtime.  She can only ensure the definition is sound.)

*** Coda

A brief meditation on the standing card --- the simplest instrument
the maker produces, and the most consequential.  A few sentences
on a card, placed on a loom frame in a workshop the maker may never
visit.  The card does not operate the loom.  The card does not
weave.  The card shapes the weaver's /attention/ --- and
attention, in a craft where errors announce themselves at the
edges, is everything.

The card is unsigned.  The weaver does not know who wrote it.  She
reads it, sets her warp, and begins.

Final image: the maker, back in her workshop in Sangla, beginning
a new card.  The old one said /inspect the archive; describe what
you find; incorporate only if in order; check the incoming tray/.
The new one --- for the review instrument, the one that must find
flaws --- says something different.  Something about looking for
what the archive is /not/ showing.  About the pattern that is
conspicuous by its absence.  About the selvedge that is too
perfect, which means someone has trimmed it, which means the
errors were there and were hidden rather than corrected.

She knots the words.  Sets the card on the bench.  Waits for the
Thread Walker's next crossing.

Final quote (in the established style of the concluding
blockquote):

#+begin_quote
/In Sangla it is held that the finest instruments are those that
have been carried over a pass: the crossing changes what it
carries, and an instrument that survives the altitude, the cold,
and the handling of a man who has too many notebooks and not enough
hands emerges calibrated to conditions the maker could not have
foreseen.  Whether this is a property of the instrument or of
the pass or of the particular quality of attention that the Thread
Walker brings to the objects in his care is a question the
Instrument Maker has considered but does not expect to resolve,
since resolution would require her to walk the pass herself, and
the pass --- by the accounts of those who have crossed it --- is
a different country on the far side, and no measurement made in
one country is valid in the other without recalibration./

--- From a notebook found in the Sangla workshop, in a hand that
is either the Instrument Maker's or the Thread Walker's, depending
on which stroke you consider diagnostic.  The ink is of a type
sold only in Reckong Peo, twelve kilometres down the valley, on
days when the government bus runs, which is most days but not all,
and never on the days when you need it.

** Notes for the Writing Agent

- Match the voice of the existing stories: scholarly but warm,
  precise but not pedantic, with the dry wit that surfaces in the
  closing blockquotes.
- Himalayan geography must be /accurate/: Sangla, Baspa, Kinnaur,
  Reckong Peo are real places.  Get the altitudes and distances
  right.  The reader who knows these valleys should recognise them.
- The parable should work on both levels simultaneously: a reader
  who knows nothing about agents should enjoy it as a story about
  mountain craft; a reader who knows the technical substrate should
  recognise every element.
- Do not explain the mapping.  The table in this plan is for the
  writer's reference.  The story itself never mentions agents,
  prompts, YAML, or tangling.
- The Instrument Maker is a new character.  She has not appeared
  in previous stories.  She is not the Thread Walker, not a
  weaver.  She is the maker of the tools the weavers use.
- The closing blockquote must follow the established pattern:
  attributed to a found document, in a hand of uncertain
  provenance, on paper from a specific and slightly improbable
  source.
- Length target: 500-600 lines of org source (15-20 min read).
