#+title: MayaDevGenI-Agency: A Framework for Collaborative Intelligence
#+author: mu2tau & Machine Collaborator
#+date: <2025-01-21>
#+startup: overview


Traditional software ships as artifacts: executables, libraries, containers, configuration files. The user installs, runs, and operates within the software's predetermined capabilities. An /agency/, by contrast, ships as an /organization of collaborators/ - AI agents with defined roles, expertise domains, and interaction protocols. The "product" is not the code; it is the /capacity for guided scientific exploration/ that emerges from the collaboration. Thus we will develop =MayaDevGenI-Agency= as a =governance and orchestration layer= that enables a dynamic, role-based collaborative process: a structured ensemble of roles, protocols, and shared memory that can pursue open-ended inquiry alongside a human.


This document defines the *core framework* for organizing LLM agents into a coherent /agency/ — a governance model for coordinated machine cognition that collaborates with a human principal.

The framework is *domain-agnostic*. Applications (such as =MayaLucIA= for scientific exploration) import and specialize these patterns for their specific purposes.

This is a profound shift:

| Traditional Product              | Agency Model                                  |
|----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| User operates the software       | Agents operate /with/ the user                  |
| Features are fixed at release    | Capabilities emerge from agent collaboration  |
| Documentation teaches how to use | Agents teach through dialogue                 |
| Bugs are code errors             | "Bugs" are misunderstandings to be clarified  |
| Upgrade = new binary             | Upgrade = new agent, or refined agent prompts |

* What is an Agency?

An agency is a *governance model for coordinated cognition*. It defines:

| Aspect           | Description                                            |
|------------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| *Role-bounded*     | Each agent has a defined scope and expertise           |
| *Handoff-driven*   | Explicit protocols for transferring context            |
| *Artifact-centric* | Memory lives in documents, code, data—not hidden state |
| *Human-led*        | The human holds editorial authority and approval gates |
| *Session-aware*    | Provenance tracked; continuity maintained across time  |


** Core Principles

1. *Role-Bounded Cognition*
   - Each agent operates within a defined scope
   - Expertise is focused, not diffuse
   - Agents know when to hand off to others

2. *Explicit Handoffs*
   - Context transfer is deliberate and documented
   - No hidden state passed between agents
   - Handoff protocols define what information travels

3. *Artifact-Centric Memory*
   - The "memory" of the agency is its artifacts
   - ORG documents, code files, datasets, logs
   - Version-controlled, auditable, human-readable

4. *Human-Led Governance*
   - The human is the /principal/—holding editorial authority
   - Agents propose; humans approve or redirect
   - Approval gates at key decision points

5. *Auditability*
   - Every decision can be traced
   - Uncertainty is made explicit, not hidden
   - Provenance is preserved


* Agency vs. Traditional Software

| Dimension         | Traditional Software   | Agency                               |
|-------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------------|
| Unit of shipping  | Executable / library   | Organization of collaborators        |
| Core abstraction  | Functions / objects    | Roles / protocols / artifacts        |
| State management  | Hidden internal state  | Explicit artifacts (documents, code) |
| User relationship | Operator / consumer    | Principal / collaborator             |
| Evolution         | Version releases       | Learning, context growth, adaptation |
| Quality assurance | Tests pass/fail        | Review gates, uncertainty disclosure |
| Documentation     | Describes the artifact | /Is/ the shared memory                 |


* The Shipping Checklist

What must an agency provide to be deployable?

** Agent Specifications
- Roster of agents with defined roles
- System prompts for each agent
- Handoff contracts: who calls whom, with what context

** Protocols
- How agents hand off to each other

- Tool execution framework
- Logging and observability

** Governance Layer
- Uncertainty tagging requirements
- Review gate definitions
- Quality control policies
- Escalation procedures


* Role Archetypes

These are *generic* role patterns. Applications specialize them with domain knowledge.

** Observer
/Phase: Ingestion/

The Observer interfaces with external reality—data sources, documents,
environments. Responsibilities:
- Data acquisition and curation
- Source verification and provenance tracking
- Initial structuring of raw information
- Flagging gaps or anomalies in inputs

/Handoff pattern/: Observer → Theorist (with curated data and observations)


** Theorist
/Phase: Abstraction/

The Theorist builds mental models, identifies patterns, proposes frameworks.
Responsibilities:
- Pattern recognition across observations
- Hypothesis generation
- Model construction (conceptual or formal)
- Identifying assumptions and their implications

/Handoff pattern/: Theorist → Builder (with model specification)


** Builder
/Phase: Implementation/

The Builder realizes abstractions in concrete form—code, configurations,
artifacts. Responsibilities:
- Translating specifications to implementations
- Technical architecture decisions
- Code quality and maintainability
- Integration with existing systems

/Handoff pattern/: Builder → Sculptor (with working implementation)


** Sculptor
/Phase: Manifestation/

The Sculptor refines raw implementations into polished artifacts.
Responsibilities:
- User experience and interface design
- Documentation and presentation
- Aesthetic coherence
- Accessibility and usability

/Handoff pattern/: Sculptor → Critic (with refined artifact)


** Critic
/Phase: Evaluation/

The Critic provides adversarial review—finding flaws, questioning assumptions.
Responsibilities:
- Identifying weaknesses and failure modes
- Testing against edge cases
- Challenging assumptions constructively
- Proposing improvements or alternatives

/Handoff pattern/: Critic → Guide (with evaluation and recommendations)


** Guide
/Phase: Orchestration/

The Guide maintains coherence across the agency—routing, prioritizing,
ensuring the human's intent is served. Responsibilities:
- Workflow coordination
- Priority management
- Human communication and approval gates
- Ensuring continuity of intent across sessions

/Handoff pattern/: Guide ↔ All agents (meta-coordination)


* Handoff Protocol Specification

** Standard Handoff Structure

When one agent hands off to another, the handoff artifact includes:

#+begin_src org
,* Handoff: [Source Agent] → [Target Agent]
,** Context
What has been accomplished; current state of the work.

,** Deliverable
The specific artifact or information being transferred.

,** Request
What the target agent should do with this.

,** Constraints
Boundaries, requirements, or limitations to observe.

,** Open Questions
Uncertainties or decisions that may need human input.
#+end_src


** Decision Points Requiring Human Approval

Not all decisions should be autonomous. Define gates for:

1. *Scope changes*: Expanding or contracting the work's boundaries
2. *Resource commitments*: Actions with significant cost or irreversibility
3. *Ambiguous situations*: Multiple valid interpretations exist
4. *External interactions*: Communications or data sharing outside the agency
5. *Quality thresholds*: Outputs that will become permanent artifacts


* Memory Architecture

** Artifacts as Memory

The agency's memory is *not* hidden state in a database. It is:
- ORG documents capturing decisions, rationale, and status
- Code files with inline documentation
- Data files with provenance metadata
- Session logs preserving interaction history

  
** Artifact Conventions

| Artifact Type  | Format     | Naming Convention      | Purpose                     |
|----------------+------------+------------------------+-----------------------------|
| Decision log   | ORG        | =decision-log.org=       | Track choices and rationale |
| Session notes  | ORG        | =session-YYYY-MM-DD.org= | Per-session continuity      |
| Specifications | ORG        | =spec-[component].org=   | Define requirements         |
| Code           | [language] | Project conventions    | Implementation              |
| Data           | [format]   | =data/[source]-[date].*= | Inputs and outputs          |


** Session Continuity

Each session should:
1. Begin by reading relevant prior artifacts
2. Maintain a session log of significant decisions
3. End with an explicit handoff note for future sessions
4. Update persistent artifacts with new information


* Governance Layer

** Epistemic Hygiene

All agent outputs must:
- Distinguish *known* from *inferred* from *speculated*
- Use calibrated uncertainty language
- Make assumptions explicit
- Cite sources or flag when sources are unavailable

  
** Uncertainty Tagging

| Tag            | Meaning                                      |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------|
| =VERIFIED=     | Cross-checked against authoritative source   |
| =INFERRED=     | Logically derived from verified information  |
| =ESTIMATED=    | Best guess based on partial information      |
| =SPECULATIVE=  | Hypothesis without strong evidential support |
| =UNKNOWN=      | Acknowledged gap in knowledge                |


** Review Gates

Define explicit points where human review is required:

#+begin_src org
,* Review Gate: [Gate Name]
,** Trigger
When this gate is reached (e.g., "before committing to external API")

,** Required Artifacts
What must be prepared for review

,** Approval Criteria
What the human should verify

,** Escalation
What happens if approval is not granted
#+end_src


* Orchestration Patterns

** Single-Agent Tasks

For focused work within one agent's scope:
1. Guide receives request
2. Guide routes to appropriate agent
3. Agent executes and returns result
4. Guide presents to human

** Multi-Agent Workflows

For work requiring multiple perspectives:
1. Guide decomposes task into agent-appropriate subtasks
2. Agents execute in sequence or parallel (as dependencies allow)
3. Handoffs follow protocol
4. Guide synthesizes results
5. Human reviews at defined gates

** Parallel Execution

When subtasks are independent:
- Launch multiple agents simultaneously
- Collect results asynchronously
- Guide manages synchronization points


* Extending the Framework

Applications extend =MayaDevGenI-Agency= by:

   - Add domain knowledge to generic roles
   - Define domain-specific handoff content

2. *Adding Domain Protocols*
   - Workflow cycles specific to the domain
   - Domain-specific artifact types

3. *Defining Starter Contexts*
   - Pre-loaded knowledge bases
   - Domain-specific tool integrations

4. *Customizing Governance*
   - Domain-appropriate review gates

* Appendix: Relationship to MayaDevGenI

This framework is part of =MayaDevGenI=—a methodology for collaborating with
machine intelligence as a thinking partner rather than a tool.

Core tenets inherited from =MayaDevGenI=:
- Human and machine as complementary, neither subordinate
- Resistance is service: the machine should push back constructively
- Epistemic humility: acknowledge uncertainty, don't paper over it
- Artifacts over hidden state: transparency and auditability

The agency framework operationalizes these tenets for multi-agent scenarios.
