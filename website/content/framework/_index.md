The MayaDevGenI Framework for Human–Machine Collaboration.


## Overview {#overview}

The [manifesto](/manifesto/) poses a question: how do we recover productive friction when working with intelligence that is eager to please?

This framework develops answers through multiple components:

-   **[System-Prompt Engineering](/framework/system-prompt-engineering/)**: Shaping LLM behavior through carefully crafted initial constraints
-   **[Tool Integration](/framework/tool-integration/)**: Enabling the LLM to act in the world—reading, searching, modifying
-   **Context Management**: Governing what information flows into and out of the conversation
-   **Project Memory**: Maintaining continuity across sessions and preserving learnings
-   **Agent Architecture**: Structuring single and multi-agent systems
-   **Evaluation and Iteration**: Testing, refining, and evolving the collaboration

For hands-on practice, see the [system-prompt tutorial](/tutorial/).
